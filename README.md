# Employee Retention and HR Metrics Analysis

### Problem Statement

Employee turnover is one of the most significant challenges organizations face today. High attrition rates can lead to increased recruitment costs, loss of institutional knowledge, and lowered morale. Additionally, performance inconsistencies and uneven career growth opportunities make it difficult for HR teams to make proactive and data-driven decisions.

This project aims to analyze employee-level HR data to identify patterns in attrition, detect retention risk areas, and uncover growth-related disparities to support HR strategies focused on workforce engagement, retention, and development.

### About data
The dataset contains information on 1,470 employees, including the following dimensions:

- **Demographics:** Age, Gender, Marital Status, Education Field
- **Job Details:** Department, Job Role, Monthly Income, Total Working Years, Years with Current Manager
- **Performance & Engagement:** Job Satisfaction, Job Involvement, Training Hours, Performance Rating
- **Attrition Indicators:** Attrition Status, Promotion Status, Tenure, Work-Life Balance

The data has been preprocessed in Python, including:
- Handling Missing Values
- Replacing Mistaken variations  

### Project Objective
To build a data-driven HR dashboard that:
- Detects key factors influencing employee attrition
- Monitors employee performance, growth, and satisfaction levels
- Supports HR leadership in making strategic decisions to reduce turnover
- Improves visibility into workforce structure and development gaps


### Dashboard Pages
**1. Employee Overview**

**2. Attrition & Retention Analysis**

**3. Performance & Growth Insights**

- Higher attrition correlates with lower monthly income, less time with current managers, and fewer promotions.
- Departments like Sales and R&D have the highest attrition counts.
- Satisfaction scores and work-life balance vary significantly with overtime status.
- Career acceleration and promotions are more prevalent among higher income groups and specific job roles.

### Tools & Techniques Used
